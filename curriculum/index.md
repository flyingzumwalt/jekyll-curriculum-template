## Curriculum Structure

A Curriculum is made up of Courses, Learning Modules, and Activities  

### Directory structures

The template assumes that you structure your curriculum like this:

```
|-- curriculum
|   |-- index.md
|   |-- course-name
|   |   |-- index.md
|   |   |-- modules
|   |   |   |-- learning-module-name
|   |   |   |   |-- index.md
|   |   |   |   |-- activities
|   |   |   |   |   |-- activity-name
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- index.md
```

For your reference, this git repository contains a complete sample curriculum in its [curriculum directory](https://github.com/flyingzumwalt/jekyll-curriculum-template/tree/gh-pages/curriculum).  In fact, you're reading the overview page from that curriculum now!
